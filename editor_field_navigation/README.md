# editor-field-navigation

A modified version of Glutanimate's [editor_field_navigation](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-addons-misc/tree/master/src/editor_field_navigation) add-on.

Modifications include:
- Compatibility with Anki 2.1.41+.
- Changing the hotkeys from `Ctrl+{i}` to `Ctrl+Shift+{i}` to avoid conflict with Anki's flagging hotkeys.
- New hotkeys, `Ctrl+Shift+Up` and `Ctrl+Shift+Down`, to focus the next and previous fields.
