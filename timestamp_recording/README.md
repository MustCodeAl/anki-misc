# timestamp-recording

Pastes a timestamp before a sound tag (e.g. `2021-10-01T02:06:21: [sound:rec1633043181.mp3]`) after recording audio.

I find it useful for seeing how my pronunciation of words and sentences changes over time.

**UPDATE**: I no longer use or maintain this. I now use [Record Own Voice History](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1508039970).
