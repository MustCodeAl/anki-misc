# tag-list

Displays a colorful list of the tags of a card at the top of the card when shown in the reviewer/previewer.

I find myself modifying most of my card templates and using the `Tags` special field to show tags at top of the card
to add more context. This is espescially useful because I have a lot of similar-looking definition cards that have
identical front fields, which I'm mostly not be able to distinguish without some context.

This add-on displays the tag list unconditionally for all note types. I may add an option to change this in the future.

## TODO
- [x] generate colors statically instead of using JS so that the front and back sides are consistent.
- [] make tags clickable with the help of the browser-link add-on. Similar to https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/380714095.
